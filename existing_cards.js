On the day that the helicopter event occurs, the Automated Emergency Broadcast System station (AEBR for short) will announce 'Air Activity detected.' at the end of every hourly automated broadcast (beginning at 9 A.M the day of the event) warning the player in advance of the helicopter. It is recommended that players stay inside for the entire day, as the helicopter will draw hordes towards the player if they're spotted by following them.",
